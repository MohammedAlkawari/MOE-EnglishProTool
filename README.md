## 🔄 CI/CD Setup

The system uses **Amazon CodeCatalyst** for automated builds and deployments, reducing manual errors and streamlining development.

### Repository Setup

1. Access the iGA private GitHub repository for the English proficiency tool.
2. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
3. Locate the `.env` file in the root directory and modify it with your AWS configuration (e.g., `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`).
4. Save the changes. The repository is now ready for deployment.

---

### CI/CD Pipeline Setup (Amazon CodeCatalyst)

#### 1. Create the Project
- Create a new project in Amazon CodeCatalyst.

#### 2. Link Repository
- Link your GitHub repository to the CodeCatalyst project as a source repository.

#### 3. IAM Setup

- **Policy**: Create a policy using the JSON file located in the `/doc` folder of this repository.  
  **Policy Name**: `GovCICDDeployPolicy`  
  > **⚠️ Note**: In case the policy is not already pushed to your account, follow these steps to create it manually.

- **Role**: Create an IAM role in your AWS account.  
  **Role Name**: `GovCICDDeployRole`  
  Attach the `GovCICDDeployPolicy` policy to this role.
#### 4. Create an Environment
- Set up deployment environments in CodeCatalyst:
  - Environment Name (e.g., `Production`, `Staging`)
  - Environment Type (Prod or Non-Prod)
  - Assign the default IAM role created above `GovCICDDeployRole` 

> **⚠️ Note**: In case the workflow is not shown create or modify the YAML workflow in CodeCatalyst with the following:
>
> - **Compute Type**: e.g., EC2  
> - **Trigger Configuration**: Automatically deploy on repository changes  
> - **Action Configurations**:
>   - Deployment scripts  
>   - Containers (if used)  
>   - IAM role  
>   - AWS account ID  
>   - Deployment stage (Dev, Prod)  
>
> This setup allows for seamless, secure, and consistent deployment of infrastructure and application code.

## ⚙️ Deployment Configurations

- The system uses **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with a minimal config approach.
- All configurations are centralized in the `.env` file for ease of management.
- Before deploying, check the **availability of the Gen-AI model** in your AWS region.

### Important:
If the model is unavailable in your region:
- Modify the model ID at  
  `REPO-ROOT/packages/functions/src/utilities.ts` (line 58)  
  to match a supported region’s model ID.
